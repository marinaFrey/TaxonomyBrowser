# TaxonomyBrowser

The process of collecting biological data is a continuous activity, specially in field work for research projects or teaching
activities. Data obtained from these collecting activities need
to be properly stored in order to be readily available for future
analysis. TaxonomyBrowser is a biodiversity information system mainly developed to manage data collected by biologists
during field work. It stores such data on a database organized
according the taxonomic tree of leaving species. This work
describes a new approach for the TaxonomyBrowserâ€™s user
interface, focusing on providing an easier and more intuitive
method of managing and visualizing the information stored
in such databases. The approach was assessed by means of a
survey conducted with users from the field of study as well as
users with no knowledge on biodiversity information systems.
The participants considered the application to be good and
mostly provided positive feedback.
